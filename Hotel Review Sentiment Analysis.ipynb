       " 'no negative no real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make new one bit confusing secondly the on site restaurant is bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of vegetarian or vegan background but even wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when return to amsterdam ',\n",
       " ' rooms are nice but for elderly bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps so ask for single level inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge location was good and staff were ok it is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice will go back ',\n",
       " ' my room was dirty and was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks white furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog my shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it on day with heavy rainfall pretty common occurrence in amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage also saw insects running on the floor overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept on top of all of this repairman who came to fix something in room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests understand the challenges of running hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel on the last night after complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when was already in bed and ready to sleep great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have lovely outdoor area the building also has quite some character ',\n",
       " ' you when booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of room thought was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly which was completely false advertising after being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife 40th birthday present please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again didn really know what was paying for and how much it had wnded up being your photos told me was getting something wasn not happy and won be using you again amazing location and building romantic setting ',\n",

       " ' nothing all great rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building pictures are of room 300 the true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly also the bath was lovely and big and inviting great more for couples restaurant menu was bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of amsterdam would recommend this hotel to anyone it unbelievably well priced too ',\n",
       " ' 6 30 am started big noise workers loading wood down the windows stupid room numbering system it took 20 minutes with night guard finally to find our rooms the check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction no late dinner bar closes at 1 am ugly view on trash lorry from windows no information about the computerized telephone huge price difference between booking com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 style location rooms',\n",
       " ' the floor in my room was filfy dirty very basic rooms had 20yr old tv in my room fridge did not work overpriced breakfast comfy bed good location ',\n",

       " ' very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one room decoration was minamilist which like but felt prison cell sparse great onsite cafe amazing building park location amazing bobby gin and tonic ',\n",
       " ' we did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this the room we stayed in was lacking in space bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening bit tricky but only small negative comment we loved the location of this hotel the fact that it is set in park away from the busy centre of dam square was great the tram system was brilliant and easy to handle the hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from ireland ',\n",
       " 'no negative public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt its an old building and clearly has old building issues ',\n",
       " ' we had issues with our electronic key everyday it deactivated it wasn kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue the staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail the tea coffee facilities weren updated daily and the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival that situation didn change other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely liked the hotels history and for such an enormous hotel can imagine how many girls were orphaned liked their breakfast it was quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs juices tea and coffee ',\n",
       " ' bed was on upper level with narrow twist staircase no usb port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv some sockets didn work and had loose covers dangerous some corridors were poorly lit friendly staff oostpark few yards away good continental breakfast selection quiet and relaxing area ',\n",
       " ' our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms we moved the couch bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine we found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated to spend more then 243 euros for dirty attic room is daylight robbery the breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet we did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional we had wedding in the hotel chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location ',\n",
       " ' sadly cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me when we got in our room we immediately notice there something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed we called the front desk and they said they will send cleaning lady to us we waited at least half an hour and no one showed up we had to go to the front desk and complain again when we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there still some hair on the spot we were however no interest to complain anymore also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there a lot of stains which had to ignore the whole time didn feel comfortable at all the staff at front desk are very friendly however guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies first you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway what more annoying is that got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms and they didn close it loudly just once but for at least on hour they kept open and close the door was really annoyed was in my holiday and just wanted to have good sleep at least the parking place was small but ok when we arrived the ticket machine was broken someone told us we don need ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in we did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out when we drove out the ticket machine was broken again so we didn actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with lot of money of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still was not so happy because have the feeling that paid for nothing the location is good you need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed the hotel locates in beautiful park and have nice interior design the bed was really comfortable ',\n",
       " ' transportation was bit of pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly ',\n",
       " ' nothing lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed we stayed in the split level room which we really liked if you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in room all on one level the oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from you can get the metro close by 8min walk or the tram is short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within 5 mins walk to the hotel all in all beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower tea and coffee facilities in your room and in location that is more relaxing than the central amsterdam we will be returning ',\n",
       " ' the bathroom in our room was black glass box it theory it cool in practice it leaves lot to be desired little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall it did however allow for loft space with desk chairs and second tv great location in the park near museums and restaurants perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right friendly and helpful staff m',\n",
       " ' nothing at all to do with the hotel of course but people tend to slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having little lay in just be prepared for slam to awake you other than that nothing to fault at all the hotel itself is in lovely location 5min if that tram ride into the center train right outside the hotel easy access to everywhere the staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds bathroom was clean spacious and airy we had shampoo body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees it literally has everything you need in the room perfect hotel couldn fault it at all the lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great tennis court outside the hotel little pond as well and huge park to walk around ',\n",
       " ' careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want relaxing stay the noise can annoy you great hotel original concept style',\n",
       " ' we had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans there was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail was kind of pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom the hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits ',\n",
       " ' there is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel the hotel restaurant is nice but overpriced the bathroom is not very practical the hotel is located in beautiful old monastery building which has special mood combined with all modern features there is big park just opposite to the hotel public transportation and nice bakery for breakfast are also close good wifi all around the hotel ',\n",
       " ' little bit on the pricey side the staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning ',\n",
       " ' extensive restorations works going on we had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view temporary reception area the building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside when the work is completed m sure it will be fabulous no fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective friendly staff the bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park very modern ',\n",
       " ' our bathroom had an urine order shower was very slippery no shower chair handles or bars bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off very expensive and breakfast was not included construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it there was park and that was nice not close to town or museums no positive',\n",
       " ' please see above the hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect however the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible ',\n",
       " ' the rooms were cold although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming it could use some design help an area rug or two the room was very big spacious the bath tub was large enough for two people love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains the park location was amazing',\n",
       " ' construction on site but not mentioned on booking com the breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms they do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable the park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent bike directly and make tour also the bathtub and bed is great ',\n",

       " ' the glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is weird solution for double it is necessary to darken the glasses much more very nice hotel located in park ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center not typical for amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings but pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed ',\n",
       " ' the only thing that would of been better is if had booked more nights but apart from that there is not really much dislike about the hotel suppose if there is one thing the room had did not have view only other rooms but dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really great deal can find that did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that the location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of amsterdam would definitely like to stay here again only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as brit and connoisseur of cooked breakfasts was little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does cooked breakfast like the english but very helpful staff and nice place to sit with coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences but not qualified to give true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time take trip to amsterdam',\n",
       " ' staff few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn make eye contact he wouldn even just say don know the answer let me find out for you there didn seem to be manager around unfortunately there is still lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished the temporary reception area is in very small dark area under the central staircase too bad breakfast was overpriced for good but ordinary buffet location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good ',\n",
